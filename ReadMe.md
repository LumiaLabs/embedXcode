## **Critical Decision Ahead**

80% of the open points on embedXcode are about Xcode, mostly keywords on the template. 

Despite numerous calls for help, they're still unresolved. The Xcode template remains undocumented and there's no sign of openness from Apple. Apple seems to restrict **Xcode** to OS X and iOS platforms only.

So I'm considering to change for another IDE, with **NetBeans** as most probable solution. It's open, and documentation is available.
